# Creating web APIs with Plumber
## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the package Plumber and its use. Plumber allows special comments (or annotations) to turn R code into API endpoints. An API (or Application Programming Interface) is a standardized way for different computers to communicate (e.g., web browsers requesting website access through API calls). Plumber reduces the handoff between work done in R and tools built using other languages and frameworks.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) recap the function and functioning of (web) APIs, (2) equip you with conceptual and structural knowledge about the Plumber package and pipeline, and (3) provide you with hands-on example and material as well as further references.
